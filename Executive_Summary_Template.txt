Executive Summary – Predicting Car Insurance Claims

Overview:
This analysis aims to develop predictive models to identify whether a car insurance policyholder will file a claim within the next 6 months. Using simplified features, we explored the relationship between customer demographics, vehicle characteristics, and claim likelihood.

Approach:
The dataset underwent cleaning and transformation. Two models were tested:
1. Logistic Regression – for interpretability.
2. Decision Tree – for capturing non-linear patterns.

Findings:
- The Decision Tree model slightly outperformed Logistic Regression in terms of precision and F1-score.
- Key predictors included age of the policyholder, car age, and number of airbags.

Recommendation:
We recommend deploying the Decision Tree model for initial pilot use. It provides actionable insights with reasonable accuracy and is easy to explain to non-technical stakeholders.
